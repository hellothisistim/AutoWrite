# How to build an Automatic Write node.

Generally, most of the information needed for the output of a Nuke script is contained in it's name. We can reduce manual name-changing on behalf of comp artists and simultaneously increase consistency by creating a Write node that creates (and updates) it's own output path by parsing the script's name. I call a Write node that's customized in this way an AutoWrite node. We're only adding a little functionality to a Write node, so instead of wrapping it in a gizmo, I find it simpler to create a Python script. This is how I set it up.

First, we drop the Write node that will become our AutoWrite.

    w = nuke.createNode('Write', inpanel=True)

Then, we look for AutoWrites that we've previously made (if any) so that our new one can have a unique name.

    count = 1
    while nuke.exists('AutoWrite' + str(count)):
        count += 1
    w.knob('name').setValue('AutoWrite' + str(count))

Most projects at most facilities will have a standard set of path fragments. My list includes: project root, sequence name (or abbreviation), shot name. Feel free to add your own. We will create a new tab  on the Write node to help us isolate each fragment so we can easily re-assemble them for the output path. This tab will contain knobs for each path fragment. 

    t = nuke.Tab_Knob("Path Fragments")
    w.addKnob(t)
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('proj_root', 'Project Root', ''))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('seq', 'Sequence', ''))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('shot', 'Shot Name', ''))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('script', 'Script Name', ''))

If you run this now, you'll get a tab with a bunch of empty knobs. This is usually how I start when I'm setting up a new show. I suck at TCL expressions, so I use the trial-and-error technique for chopping up my script path into the appropriate fragments. And for that technique you need feedback about what your expression is doing. For that reason, I use the AutoWrite's label to display the output of the individual fragment knobs as well as the full output path.

    feedback = """
    Output Path: [value file]
    
    Project Root: [value proj_root]
    Sequence: [value seq]
    Shot Name: [value shot]
    Script Name: [value script]
    """
    w.knob('label').setValue(feedback)

The next step is to figure out what expressions you need to use in the path fragments tab to hack your useful bits out of your path. Here's what a common path loks like for me:

    /Volumes/PICO/show/testproj/abc/abc123/nuke/abc123_comp_v01.nk

And these are the expressions I use to create each chunk:

Project Root: 
In this case, the show root directory consists of the first 5 path components, so I can just split them, limit the range and re-join.  

    [join [lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 0 4 ] / ]

If your facility uses environment variables, you may be able to use something nicely simple like [getenv SHOW_DIR].

Path component #6 is my sequence abbreviation, so Sequence goes like this:

    [lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 5 5 ]

Repeat that idea for Shot Name:

    [lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 6 6 ]

Script Name is nicely simple -- we can just take the last path component and split the extensinon off of it.

    [file rootname [file tail [value root.name] ] ]

Once you've figured these out for your facility, you can put them in the knobs during creation. So now the section that created the tab should look like this:

    t = nuke.Tab_Knob("Path Fragments")
    w.addKnob(t)
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('proj_root', 'Project Root', '[join [lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 0 4 ] / ]'))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('seq', 'Sequence', '[lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 5 5 ]'))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('shot', 'Shot Name', '[lrange [split [value root.name] / ] 6 6 ]'))
    w.addKnob(nuke.EvalString_Knob('script', 'Script Name', '[file rootname [file tail [value root.name] ] ]'))

All that's left is to re-assemble the path components in the file knob:

    output_path = "[value proj_root]/[value seq]/[value shot]/comps/[value script]/[value input.width]x[value input.height]/[value script].%04d.dpx"
    w.knob('file').fromScript(output_path)

And that's it. Running this script will create and customize a Write node and set it to follow along as the script's name is updated.

##Here's the catch:

This script creates output paths that often don't exist on the filesystem. This will cause an error from Nuke when you start a render. The solution to this problem is to implement the beforeRender callback (createWriteDir()) described in the Nuke documentation (pg 575 in the Nuke6.1v2 manual.)

My finished version of this script is [here on Nukepedia](http://www.nukepedia.com/gizmos/python-scripts/nodegraph/autowrite/).
