AutoWrite

Semi-automatic output paths in [The Foundry's Nuke](http://www.thefoundry.co.uk/products/nuke/). A tool by [Tim BOWMAN](http://netherlogic.com).

#The gist: 
Create output paths by parsing the Nuke script name and path.

#The theory:
Most of the information needed for the output of a Nuke script is contained in it's name. We can reduce manual name changing on behalf of the artists and simultaneously increase consistency by creating a Write node that creates (and updates) it's own output path by parsing the script's name.

#The details:
Most projects at most facilities will have a common set of path fragments. My list includes: project root, sequence name (or abbreviation), shot name. We will create a new tab  on the Write node to help us isolate each fragment so we can easily re-assemble them for the output path. This tab will contain knobs for each path fragment. 

Since each facility creates their own file structure, I will set it up for my structure and then leave it to you how to parse your own path for each fragment.
